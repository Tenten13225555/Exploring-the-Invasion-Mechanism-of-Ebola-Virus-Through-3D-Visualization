# Exploring-the-Invasion-Mechanism-of-Ebola-Virus-Through-3D-Visualization

3D visualization model of the Ebola Virus. Aims to provide a deeper understanding of the process by which the Ebola virus invades human cells and causes disease. The project will use 3D modeling techniques to visualize the interactions between the Ebola virus and host cells, providing a unique and intuitive view of the virus's invasion mechanism.

This project is expected to provide valuable insights into the inner workings of the Ebola virus, which will help in the development of more effective treatments and preventions for this devastating disease. The 3D visualization will allow for a dynamic and interactive exploration of the Ebola virus's actions, making the information accessible and engaging to a wide range of audiences.
